Notes for me to remember steps involved in publishing this package

- adjust version number in 'setup.py'
- adjust version number in 'docs/conf.py'

- make bundle by running:
    - You probably want to cleanup
    python setup.py clean --all
    rm -rf dist
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

- upload to TEST pypi
tine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

- upload to official pypi repo
twine upload dist/*

For CONDA package

- from a DIFFERENT    directory  and conda environment
conda install anaconda-client conda-build
conda skeleton pypi domcmc
conda build domcmc

- Can test local build with:
conda install -c file:///home/ords/mrd/rpndat/dja001/python_miniconda3/envs/test1/conda-bld/ domcmc --override-channels

- Add to local conda channel:

add the bz2 file to:
/home/dja001/shared_stuff/conda_channel/linux-64/
Go in 
/home/dja001/shared_stuff/
and run:

- test the conda package in a frest conda environment with:
conda install domcmc -c /home/dja001/shared_stuff/conda_channel --override-channels
