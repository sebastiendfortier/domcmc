Notes for me to remember steps involved in publishing this package

Packages to install for a development environment where we can run the tests and build this package

    conda install -c conda-forge doctest sphinx sphinx-autodoc-typehints sphinx-gallery sphinx_rtd_theme scipy cartopy twine

    comment the "install_requires" in setup.py
    pip install /path/to/domcmc --editable  

    comment the "install_requires" in setup.py
    pip install /path/to/domutils --editable  

- On a separate issue branch
    make changes
    run tests

        cd docs
        make clean
        make doctest
        make html

    make/adjust documentation page

- adjust version number in 
    - VERSION
    - conda_build/domcmc/meta.yaml

- add change to CHANGELOG.md

- make bundle by running:
    - You probably want to cleanup
    python setup.py clean --all
    rm -rf dist
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

- upload to TEST pypi
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

- upload to official pypi repo
twine upload dist/*

For CONDA package

- from the root of the repo
    To load in environment if not already done:
    conda install anaconda-client conda-build
conda build --py 3.7 --py 3.8 --py 3.9 --py 3.10 conda_build/domcmc

Test the built package in a new environment:

conda create -n domcmc_test domcmc --use-local

- If everything worked out, squash commits and push to gitlab master

    - Can test local build with:
    conda install -c file:///home/ords/mrd/rpndat/dja001/python_miniconda3/envs/test1/conda-bld/ domcmc --override-channels

- Add to local conda channel:

add the bz2 file to:
/home/dja001/shared_stuff/conda_channel/linux-64/
Go in 
/home/dja001/shared_stuff/
and run:
conda index conda_channel/


- test the conda package in a frest conda environment with:
conda install domcmc -c /home/dja001/shared_stuff/conda_channel --override-channels
or
conda upgrade domcmc -c /home/dja001/shared_stuff/conda_channel --override-channels

- push the docs
rsync -auv --delete docs/_build/html/ /home/dja001/public_html/domcmc/
